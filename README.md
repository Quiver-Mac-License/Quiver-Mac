## Overview

<a href="#">Quiver for macOS</a> is designed for developers who want their notes to keep pace with their code. Instead of forcing everything into plain text, it organises content into cells that can be Markdown, code, LaTeX or rich text. This makes it natural to mix explanations, examples and experiments in one place, without losing clarity. Notebooks and tags help structure larger collections of notes across projects, technologies and roles, turning Quiver into a long-term technical journal.

Code cells support syntax highlighting and execution via external interpreters, depending on language and setup. This turns certain notebooks into living tutorials or experiment pads, where outputs and adjustments stay next to the logic they relate to. With <a href="#">search and snippet reuse</a>, frequently used patterns or commands can be surfaced quickly, cutting down on time spent hunting through old repositories or terminals. Sync options allow notes to travel across machines through existing storage solutions.

On macOS, Quiver feels like a native citizen, adopting platform conventions for windows, shortcuts and typography. It can sit next to an editor, terminal and browser, acting as the glue that holds together research, decisions and small bits of reusable code. Over time, it becomes the place developers return to when they need to remember how they solved a problem months ago or when they want to document a new approach as they discover it.
